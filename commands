cat                      # take file content and concatate on console
wc                       # word count // how many word in file
whatis wc                # whatis tell output command details
man wc                   # munaul for all the commands on terminal
ls directory/*.csv       # list all files of specific format

______________________history & Fast Tracking__________________

up arrow key            #to check previous commands
history
!540                    # run commands of the history by Pank command
ctrl+R                  # To search the command from history

______________________Pipe & chaining commands_________________

head filename                      #show first 10 lines of file
cat filename | 2nd command         #cat iris.csv | wc    //output of first input of 2nd
grep "setosa" iris.csv             #find the line having setosa  //work on regex
cat iris.csv | grep "setosa" | wc               #3-level composition
cat iris.csv | grep "setosa" |grep "3.5" | wc   #4-level composition


______________________Redirecting Output to files______________

echo "write anything on console"     
echo "something" > filename              #redirect output to the file
cat iris.csv | grep "setosa" > setosa_1.csv  #redirect the output to file


______________________Remove , move and other stuff_____________

mv setosat.csv setosa.csv                    #remain the file
cp iris.csv iris-backup.csv                  #this will create copy of file
mv iris-backup.csv backup/iris.csv           #remaining of file while mv
cp -r folder folder-backup                   #-r because folder have multiple files
